# #art-village-notes & straight-line selling
* find your art villages
* you’ve got to give your work visibility
* associate with artists that are doing better than you are
* the value is emotional & logical, redesign with the sale to appeal to the 
	* people that buy art usually do it locally
	* value is built on the emotional connection with the piece, and is subjective
		* social proof
* differentiate between vision & strategy
	* vision = beliefs, politics ec. 
	* strategy = hiring for pr, marketing, color uses, gallery choices, prices vs. prints etc., paper on canvas? 
	* objectives = money, attention, communication, etc. identified, 30-70% spent on the “career” part
* business partners, like businesses have, share the vision
* apply the creativity from the artwork to the career
* develop the long view, as the dialog between the work and the artist
* develop the 10 year picture
	* 1 person museum show? 
	* intent to be in every major history book? 
	* can be revised every 5 minutes, even better 3-6 months
* have a role model, or several role models
	* don’t assume you can’t call the person
* “Sincerity. If you can fake that, then you’ve got it made.”
	* the attitude sells, it’s the value. people want to say “I knew him when”.
* If you believe that what you are creating is any good, you have an obligation to get it out into the world. 
* Images of your art on your person, phone or tablet counts. 
* What does your art do, “elevator pitch”
* When the Swedes invaded, they burned their ships when they got to land. 
* Getting out there, got to spend at least 20 hours / week making art, then: 
	* Going to openings
	* “Grow your community”
	* Talking to art gallery people
	* Trying to find galleries
	* build relationships with gallery owners. 
* It’s important to have a singular body of work, and work in paragraphs, is old school, 
	* now its important to be interesting, abstract, photography, whatever you want, as long as its you.
* Art schools “pontificate” on philosophy, a doctorate on studio work is absurd. 
* So much of your art work comes from the powerful life experiences. Frida. 
* Many artists don’t need galleries, some do. 
	* Art fairs. 
	* Curators. 
	* Museum. 
	* Growing an audience. 
	* Internet.
