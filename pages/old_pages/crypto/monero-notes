more notes: 
the equation of exchange in economics


 - M*V = P*Q
	m = circulation
  	v = velocity

	p = prive level of currency
	q = indec of expenditures (inflation)

doubling the inflation will double the price? 
minimum tail emission? 
Peter Resises paper? 

s than 1 minute block syize sync, nany faster and theylll start having latency issues, 
  - what if we used bittorrent for syncing the or torrent style sync
