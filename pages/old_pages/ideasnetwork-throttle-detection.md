So here’s the idea, 
* take a sample of the users network activities. 
* replay the traffic across the network at various node sites to simulate actual usage across different, randomized points in the world
* store the aggregate data
* report it on the website in real-time
* give discounts or some kind of financial reward to participants, either “throttle-free traffic points”

* similar to tor, this would be a network of home-user vpns. 
* capture traffic in the home, 
* exit it through another point in the network 
* use wireguard 
* capture the traffic, and morph it using an fpga into video data.
