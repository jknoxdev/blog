Connect to WiFi

To find out the name of the WiFi driver, type the ifconfig command as root

illy# ifconfig | grep flag
lo0: flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 32768
em0: flags=8802<BROADCAST,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
iwm0: flags=808843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST,AUTOCONF4> mtu 1500
enc0: flags=0<>
pflog0: flags=141<UP,RUNNING,PROMISC> mtu 33136

iwm0 is the Intel WiFi driver. To connect to my home WiFi with wpa2 encryption make a hostname.if file like this...

illy# echo "join myhomewifi wpakey pass_phrase" >> /etc/hostname.iwm0
illy# echo "dhcp" >> /etc/hostname.iwm0

and check the file for typos...

illy# cat /etc/hostname.iwm0

Then restart the network...

illy# sh /etc/netstart
