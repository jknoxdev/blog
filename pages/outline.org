**** why I'm writing a blog 2023
 - because John Sonmez said [so](https://medium.com/@jsonmez) 
 - organization
 - seo
 - job hunting sucks and reddit can only take you so far
 - my notes folder is overflowing
 - from the 15 different browser favorites pages I have, it's becoming impossible to manage
 - place that I can start documenting my work to make it externally facing. My org file is also becoming impossible to manage.
